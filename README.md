Sticky content using jQuery
==============

A small js script to add and remove classes at different scroll points depending on js calculated heights to make an element stick inside a wrapper.
<br/>You just need to add two classes to the HTML 'sticky-wrapper' & 'sticky-cell'. The JS adds and removes the 'stuck' classes. The rest is handled in the CSS.
<br/>The media query switches the positioning to cancel the stickyness for responsive layouts.
